## Master thesis
My master thesis aimed at building confidence bands for stochastic processes from a sample of trajectories. Several methods were considered. We proposed to solve a problem of area minimization with chance constraints. If its resolution was intractable in practice, it turned out that a sample average approximation provided good results and had theoretical guarantees.
