## Numerical solvers for the Beurling LASSO

During my master thesis, I implemented (in Julia) two solvers for the Beurling LASSO. The first one relies on semi-definite relaxations (Lasserre hierarchies), while the second one uses the sliding Frank-Wolfe algorithm. See  [this repository](https://github.com/rpetit/BeurlingLasso.jl).
